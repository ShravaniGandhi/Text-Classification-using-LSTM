        "# **Text Classification using LSTM**\n",
        "Text classification using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) RNNs is an advanced approach for categorizing text data, such as identifying spam messages in an SMS dataset. In traditional methods, models like Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression may classify texts based on word frequencies or embeddings, but these approaches often fail to capture sequential patterns in the text. LSTM, a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), is designed to overcome this limitation by preserving information over time, making it highly effective for understanding sequential data such as text.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of the SMS dataset, which includes labeled \"ham\" (non-spam) and \"spam\" messages, LSTM models are particularly useful for capturing the dependencies between words or phrases in each message. Unlike standard RNNs, LSTM incorporates gates (input, forget, and output) that help retain or discard information at different time steps, allowing the model to focus on the relevant context of the message while ignoring irrelevant parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset consists of short text messages, which makes LSTM an ideal model, as it can identify patterns in the order of words and phrases that contribute to distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages. The LSTM model processes each message word by word, and by the end of the sequence, it produces a feature representation that helps classify whether the message is spam or ham. This method leverages the model’s ability to capture long-term dependencies in text, leading to more accurate predictions than traditional models."

        "# **About Dataset**\n",
        "The dataset consists of SMS messages categorized into two classes: \"ham\" (non-spam) and \"spam\" (unsolicited or unwanted messages). It contains two primary columns: the first column (`v1`) holds the labels indicating whether a message is \"ham\" or \"spam,\" and the second column (`v2`) contains the actual text of the messages. Additionally, there are three unnamed columns that contain only missing or `NaN` values, which are likely irrelevant for the analysis and can be removed. This dataset is commonly used in tasks like spam detection, where models are trained to classify SMS messages based on their content."
