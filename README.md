# Text-Classification-using-LSTM
This project implements Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for text classification, effectively capturing sequential dependencies in textual data. It preprocesses text, converts it into embeddings, and trains an LSTM-based model for tasks like sentiment analysis, spam detection, or topic classification.
